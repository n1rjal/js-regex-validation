# Input Value Validation using regex in JS

## What is Regex
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching
algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings,
or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
